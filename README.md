# Petz - Full-Stack Web Development

Petz is a dating app, a web application that I've developed to put my programming skills into practice, focusing on ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and Angular. While the frontend may not resemble a final product, it served as an excellent opportunity for me to hone my skills in Angular.
